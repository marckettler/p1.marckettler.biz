			<h1>Marc Kettler</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Marc Kettler and I am currently the Lab Manager and a Tutor for the Mathematics and CIS Department at the SUNY College at Old Westbury.
                I am also quite possibly the worst content creator around. With that in mind I figured it would be safe to just ramble a little bit. 
                I suppose it is best that I mention the fact that I just got married in June. I just have this feeling that if I neglect to mention my lovely 
                wife Sung and how important she is to me there may be dire consequences. I also better mention that Sung has the cutest dog I have ever seen.
                If I neglect to mention Kiwi the situation will probably go from dire consequences to divorce court. If I wasn't being lazy I would put a picture
                of the dog on this page. I guess I will just have to address the missing photo in the next commit.

				The code editor I started using was Eclipse Kepler with the Egit plug-in. That proved to be more annoying than functional for me so I have chosen
                to switch to Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 and the command line. Command line and the GitHub App seem to be a better alternative at this time and Dreamweaver
                will do for this project. I will most likely switch to PhpStorm but since at this point the project we are working on is more about the workflow I will
                stick with what I have.
