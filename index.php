			<h1>Marc Kettler</h1>
			<p>
				As the heading above states my name is Marc Kettler.
				I am currently the Lab Manager and a Tutor for the Mathematics 
				and CIS Department at the SUNY College at Old Westbury.
				I am also quite possibly the worst content creator around.
				So for now this will suffice as I am just working out the details
				of this project's workflow. Hopefully you will not see this in my
				Final submission as I would like to make this page slightly better
				than this simple paragraph.
			</p>
			<p>
				The code editor I am currently using is Eclipse Kepler Release with
				the handy dandy Egit Plugin which at this time seems more painful
				then just simply using the command line.
